Project Overview

The Smart Traffic Management System leverages AI and computer vision to analyze traffic conditions. By processing images from traffic cameras, the system detects vehicles, counts them, and dynamically adjusts traffic signals to optimize traffic flow. It also provides route recommendations to drivers, helping them avoid congested areas.

This project is built with Django , a robust Python web framework, and integrates OpenCV for car detection. The user interface is clean, professional, and intuitive, ensuring ease of use for both technical and non-technical users.

# Key Features
Real-Time Traffic Monitoring : Capture and process live traffic images to detect vehicles.
Car Detection and Counting : Use AI models (e.g., Haar Cascades or YOLO) to count cars in real-time.
Dynamic Traffic Signal Control : Adjust traffic lights based on vehicle density to minimize congestion.
Route Recommendations : Suggest alternative routes to drivers based on current traffic conditions.
Professional UI : A sleek and modern interface for visualizing traffic data and signal statuses.
Scalable Design : Built to handle multiple traffic lanes and adapt to different scenarios.
Technologies Used
Backend : Django (Python web framework)
Frontend : HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with Bootstrap for styling)
AI/ML : OpenCV for image processing and car detection
Database : SQLite (default), but can be extended to PostgreSQL for production
Static Files : CSS and JavaScript for a polished UI
Deployment : Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud (optional)
Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9 or higher
Git
Pip (Python package manager)
Steps to Set Up
 # Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-traffic-management.git
cd smart-traffic-management

# Set Up a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Start the Development Server

python manage.py runserver

# Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

 # How to Use
Upload a Traffic Image
On the homepage, click the "Upload Traffic Image" button.
Select an image file of a traffic scene (JPEG or PNG format).
View Results
The system will process the image, detect cars, and display the results.
Youâ€™ll see:
The number of cars detected.
An image with bounding boxes around detected cars.
The current traffic signal status and recommendations.
Simulate Real-Time Traffic
Replace the uploaded image with live camera feeds or video streams for real-time monitoring.

# Deployment
To deploy the system to a production environment:

 # Choose a Hosting Platform :
Popular options include Heroku , AWS , or Google Cloud .
Configure Environment Variables :
Store sensitive information (e.g., secret keys) in environment variables.
Set Up a Production Database :
Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better performance and scalability.
Deploy the Application :
Follow the hosting platformâ€™s documentation to deploy the Django app.
Enable HTTPS :
Use services like Letâ€™s Encrypt to secure your application.
